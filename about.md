## Branding Is Covenant, Not Commerce

Ask ten people what a brand is, and you’ll hear ten different answers: a logo, a color scheme, a website, a clever tagline. But the truth is deeper. A brand is your covenant — the promise you live out with integrity, consistency, and legacy. 

That’s the revelation behind my book, *God’s Original Brand: 7 Steps to Building a Brand that Lasts an Eternity*. God Himself was the first brand-builder, embedding His identity and covenant into creation. My mission is to help entrepreneurs and creators align their brands with the same eternal principles.

### My Journey: From Atrocious Brand to Eternal Purpose

My own life used to be the anatomy of a failed brand — inconsistency, broken promises, and self-destruction. I projected an image that wasn’t true, and eventually, it all collapsed.  

But in the rubble, I found grace. Through scripture, faith, and painful lessons, I discovered that branding isn’t about gimmicks or trends. It’s about covenant. It’s about identity, story, trust, influence, multiplication, and legacy — the Divine 7 Framework.  

Today, I help others avoid the traps I fell into and build brands rooted in integrity, authenticity, and eternal impact.

### My Core Beliefs

* **Your Brand Is Your Covenant:** It’s not a logo; it’s the promises you live and keep.  
* **Authenticity Is Non-Negotiable:** Who you are matters more than who you pretend to be.  
* **Service Is the Best Strategy:** A brand rooted in service multiplies naturally.  
* **Legacy Over Likes:** We’re building brands that will outlast trends and leave generational impact.

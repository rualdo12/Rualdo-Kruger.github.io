## Branding Is Covenant, Not Commerce

Ask ten people what a brand is, and you’ll hear ten different answers: a logo, a color scheme, a website, a clever tagline. But the truth is deeper. A brand is your covenant — the promise you live out with integrity, consistency, and legacy. 

That’s the revelation behind Rualdo Kruger's book, *God’s Original Brand: 7 Steps to Building a Brand that Lasts an Eternity*. God Himself was the first brand-builder, embedding His identity and covenant into creation. Rualdo's mission is to help entrepreneurs and creators align their brands with the same eternal principles.

### The Journey of Rualdo Kruger: From Atrocious Brand to Eternal Purpose

Rualdo's life used to be the exact anatomy of a failed brand — inconsistency, broken promises, and self-destruction. He projected an image that wasn’t true, and eventually, it all collapsed.  

But in the rubble, he found grace. Through scripture, faith, and painful lessons, Rualdo discovered that branding isn’t about gimmicks or trends. It’s about covenant. It’s about identity, story, trust, influence, multiplication, and legacy — the Divine 7 Framework.  

Today, Rualdo Kruger helps others avoid the traps that he fell into and build brands rooted in integrity, authenticity, and eternal impact.
